# Queen Shara's Form

This is my **first project**, where I created a fill-out form with a touch of art and creativity. I wanted to go beyond the usual and add some personal flair to the design, blending functionality with aesthetic elements.

The form lets you enter your details, offers some interesting choices, and adds a little mystery to make it more engaging. This project reflects my approach to combining code and creativity.

Feel free to explore it and let me know what you think!
